# Twitch-HTML5-Player-UI-Replacer-for-Chrome
This is just a terribly ghetto-rigged extension for Chrome that shouldn't really be used at all, but at least it works... right?  
If you have no idea what this is, read about this: [http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/07/video-player-controls-now-in-html/](http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/07/video-player-controls-now-in-html/).

# Install notes
1. Download this and extract it so you have a "Twitch HTML5 Player UI Replacer.crx" file.
2. Open a new tab and paste this into the URL bar: chrome://extensions/
3. Drag the "Twitch HTML5 Player UI Replacer.crx" into the Chrome Extensions page. Click "Add" when it prompts you to.
4. Refresh any stream/channel page you're on and it should automatically replace the player with the new beta one after the page has fully loaded.
